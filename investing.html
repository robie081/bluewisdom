                                    <p>"The most important thing is ... Pulling it all together." <span class="italic">Howard Marks</span></p>
                                    <p>Reason must overcome emotions.</p>
                                    <p>The relationship between price and value holds the ultimate key to investment success.</p>
                                    <p>Being part of the herd is a formula for disaster; be contrarian, especially at the extremes.</p>
                                    <p>The longer you stay in the game, the greater the chances of winning.</p>
                                    <p>What the wise man does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.</p>
                                    <p>When others investors are unworried, we should be cautious. When investors are panicked we should turn aggresive.</p>
                                    <p>The great opportunities to buy and sell are associated with valuation extremes.</p>
                                    <p>Buying based on strong value, low price relative to value and depressed general psychology is likely to provide the best results.</p>
                                    <p>It can require patience and fortitude to held positions long enough to be proved right.</p>
                                    <p>The risk that matters most is the risk of permanent loss.</p>
                                    <p>If we avoid the losers, the winners will take care of themseves.</p>
                                    <p>Margin for error is a critical element in defensive investing. Buying only when price is well below value will give you staying power.</p>
                                    <p>Few of us can be content to act only once every few years.</p>
