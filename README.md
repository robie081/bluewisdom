# bluewisdom
A personal project as I like great quotes and adages of timeless wisdom.  
I've tried to style it in a minimalist way.  
I practiced responsive and fluid design across different browser widths, mobile first.  
I've used Flex, Grid, Google Material Design and SVGs for Hamburger Icons.  
The main section is an Accordion Toggle with first accordion open by default.
One issue I couln't overcome yet is the blank space at the bottom of the accordions when I change the browser width.  
I used HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript.
