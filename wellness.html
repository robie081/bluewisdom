                                    <p>Wabi-Sabi is finding beauty in imperfection.</p> 
                                    <p>It's the subtle art of being at peace with yourself and your surroundings.</p>
                                    <p>It reminds us that we are all transient beings on this planet.</p>
                                    <p>It takes a mind quiet enough to appreciate muted beauty, willingness to accept things as they are - without ornamentation.</p>
                                    <p>It depends on the ability to slow down, to shift the balance from doing to being, to appreciating rather than perfecting.</p>
                                    <p>"A growth mindset can be powered by one word, 'yet'. The word 'yet' allows us to acknowledge that we don not know something and that we are capable of learning it.' <span class="italic">Launchcode</span></p>
                                    <p>"The first rule of a happy life is low expectations. That's one you can easily arrange. If you have unrealistic expectations, you're going to be miserable all your life." <span class="italic">Charlie Munger</span></p>
                                    <p>"Drink from the well of your self and begin again." <span class="italic">Charles Bukowski</span></p>
                                    <p>"Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for." <span class="italic">Epicurus</span></p>
                                    <p>View every challenge as an opportunity.</p>
                                    <p>"Nothing is invented, for it's written in nature first." <span class="italic">Antoni Gaudi</span></p>
                                    <p>"Find what you love and let it kill you." <span class="italic">Charles Bukowski</span></p>
                                    <p>“You don't have a lot of envy, you don't have a lot of resentment, you don't overspend your income, you stay cheerful in spite of your troubles, you deal with reliable people and you do what you’re supposed to do. All these simple rules work so well to make your life better.” <span class="italic">Charlie Munger</span></p>
                                    <p>"Try! And if you're going to try, go all the way." <span class="italic">Charles Bukowski</span></p>

                                    <p>"Children who haven't been taught to face challenges will try to avoid any challenge." <span class="italic">Alfred Adler</span></p>        
                                    <p>Failure is an important part of success.</p>
                                    <p>Great excesses lead to great dissatisfaction.</p>
                                    <p>The greatest benefit of self-sufficiency is freedom.</p>                                                    
                                    <p>Man creates his own hell in trying to make the world his heaven.</p>
                                    <p>Excess kills but scarcity is wisdom. A hungry stomach is full of wisdom.</p>
                                    <p>Live a simple life in which you take only what you really need.</p>
                                    <p>"I think that a life properly lived is just learn, learn, learn all the time." <span class="italic">Charlie Munger</span></p>
                                    <p>"This is the precept by which I have lived: prepare for the worst, expect the best and take what comes." <span class="italic">Hanna Arendt</span></p>

                                    <p>Direction is so much more important than speed. Many are going nowhere, fast.</p>
