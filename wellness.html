                            <p>"Joys and love will boost your enzyme factor, sometimes in a spectacular way. Set aside a little time every day to adopt an attitude of gratitude. Laugh. Sing. Dance. Live your life, approach your work with passion and commitment, and love with all your heart." <span class="italic">dr. Hiromi Shinya</span></p>
                            <p>Enjoy the little things, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things.</p>

                            <p>"The hollowness and lack of genuine enjoyment of life...are familiar patterns. They are attempts at a race against time." <span class="italic">Elliot Jaques</span></p>
                            <p>The things you own end up owning you.</p>
                            <p>"Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called present." <span class="italic">Oogway</span></p>

                            <p>Wealth is inner-peace. Find joy from within ourselves and from our relationships.</p>
                            <p>The importance of being happy with simple things.</p>
                            <p>Time freedom, location freedom, financial freedom and freedom from other people's expectations.</p>                                                    
                            <p>Not all those that wander are lost.</p>
                            <p>"No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted." <span class="italic">Aesop</span></p>

                            <p>No physical or mental accomplishment is necessary for happiness. The purest and most successful form of hedonism I've experimented with involves simply clearing my mind of all concerns and creating a sense of utmost bliss. I've never experienced a better feeling than that of not caring what happens to me.</p>
                            <p>If you remain open, joy will find you.</p>
                            <p>Don't worry about dying. Worry about not living. Be brave.</p>
                            <p>Out of sight is out of mind.</p>

                            <p>Live on the bright side. Try to find something good in everyone, even people you don't like.</p>
                            <p>The tree of life.</p>
                            <p>Life goes on. People pass along. Nothing stays the same.</p>
                            <p>Mother. Father. Always you wrestle inside me.</p>
                            <p>There are two ways through life. The way of Nature and the way of Grace.</p>
                            <p>It takes fierce and will to get ahead in this world.</p>
                            <p>The only way to be happy is to love. Unless you love, your life will flash by.</p>
                            <p>Don't let anyone tell you there's anything you can't do.</p>

                            <p>Everyone must choose one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.</p>
