                                    <p>Wabi-Sabi is finding beauty in imperfection.</p> 
                                    <p>It's the subtle art of being at peace with yourself and your surroundings.</p>
                                    <p>It reminds us that we are all transient beings on this planet.</p>
                                    <p>It takes a mind quiet enough to appreciate muted beauty, willingness to accept things as they are - without ornamentation.</p>
                                    <p>It depends on the ability to slow down, to shift the balance from doing to being, to appreciating rather than perfecting.</p>
                                    <p>"If your compassion does not include yourself it is incomplete." <span class="italic">J Kornfield</span></p>
                                    <p>"The only constant in life is change." <span class="italic">Russell Clark</span></p>
                                    <p>"If thou wilt make a man happy, add not unto his riches, but take away from his desires." <span class="italic">Epicurus</span></p>
                                    <p>"Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for." <span class="italic">Epicurus</span></p>
                                    <p>View every challenge as an opportunity.</p>
                                    <p>"Nothing is invented, for it's written in nature first." <span class="italic">Antoni Gaudi</span></p>
                                    <p>"Whreof we cannot speak, thereof we must remain silent." <span class="italic">L. Wittgenstein</span></p>
                                    <p>Work is the best friend I have.</p>
                                    <p>Work well done does good to the man who does it. It makes him a better man.</p>
                                    <p>"We do not rise to the level of our expectations but fall to the level of our training." <span class="italic">Miyamoto Musashi</span></p>
                                    <p>"And from the best of the strange, perhaps nothing." <span class="italic">Charles Bukowski</span></p>

                                    <p>"We are here to laugh at the odds and live our lives so well that Death will tremble to take us." <span class="italic">Charles Bukowski</span></p>        
                                    <p>Wilderness heals with its austerity.</p>
                                    <p>We have not inherited the Earth from our ancestors, indeed we have borrowed it from our children.</p>
                                    <p>We are all custodians of Mother Earth.</p>                                                    
                                    <p>We are happy because of our relationships, our close social ties and our unity.</p>
                                    <p>Excess kills but scarcity is wisdom. A hungry stomach is full of wisdom.</p>
                                    <p>Live a simple life in which you take only what you really need.</p>
                                    <p>Death is not the greatest loss in life. Loss is when life dies inside you while you are alive</p>
                                    <p>"This is the precept by which I have lived: prepare for the worst, expect the best and take what comes." <span class="italic">Hanna Arendt</span></p>
                                    <p>"Seek nothing outside of yourself." <span class="italic">Miyamoto Musashi</span></p>
